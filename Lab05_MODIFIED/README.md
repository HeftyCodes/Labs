This is my 5th lab that I created in my scripting and systems class and what I did here is I worked with string manipulation to find and organize text from a .txt file. The idea was to get a the stock prices of FAANG and find all the opening and closing values. My code takes the user input of the stock they wish to look at and then it takes that input and fetches all the data on that stock and prints it out to the user.
