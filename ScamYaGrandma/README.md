This is my python project that I worked on for my midterms, what I did for my project is I built a python script for web scraping. My python code scrapes the html code of any website you input and it creates a replica html file and a php file for it. The idea of this code is to make website cloning easier because it edits the html code to send all action attribute data to the php file so once you clone the website all you have to do is host the website on your network and send out the link to your folder and once someone inputs their credentials for the website it will store it in the php file if that makes sense.
