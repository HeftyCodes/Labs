For lab 4 my professor wanted me to work with string manipulation so for this lab I had to parse through data from a .txt file in order to accomplish this lab. In the txt file there is spam log from a spam filter software and what I need to do with this information is I need to write a piece of code that checks how many emails are in the spam log,how many are suspicious or innocent,how many are sent between midnight and noon,how many are sent between noon and midnight,the confidence of flagging spam emails, and the confidence of flagging innocent emails.
